# üè• Healthcare Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

This repository presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing hospital discharge data from the New York State Department of Health. The dashboard delivers insights into patient demographics, clinical procedures, geographic distribution, and healthcare costs across multiple facilities and regions.

## üéØ Objective

To empower healthcare stakeholders with data-driven insights that reveal:
- Patterns in hospital admissions and discharges.
- Key drivers of healthcare costs.
- High-risk patient segments based on clinical severity and demographics.
- Geographic and institutional disparities in care delivery.
